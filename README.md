Quines
======
A compilation of quines of various implementations! I originally wanted to make a repository strictly of quines in Go, but did not want to limit contributors to the repo and its usefulness. I instead opted to create branches by language. A license is present in the interest of contributors. I welcome any suggestions to remove it. 

###Contributing
If you'd like to include a quine, simply create a file with your name, Github username, or any description in the correct folder. Although very useful, contact info/explanations are optional. Feel free to make a pull request against a master or language specific branch.
